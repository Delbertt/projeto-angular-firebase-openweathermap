# ProjetoAngularFirebaseWeatherForecastApp

## About

The goal for this project is to get in practice my studies with angular, specially with route guards, redirects, api requests and authentication.
In this application the user is directed to a landing page where is given a "google login with" that will guarantee access to the weather page after he insert his credentials (provided by auth services). The weather page will give him information about his city weather.

* if the user wasn't logged in he will be redirected to login page
* if so, user will be redirected to weather page
